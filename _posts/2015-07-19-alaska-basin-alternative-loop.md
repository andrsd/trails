Usually, this trail is hiked as [In and Out]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-08-30-alaska-basin%}).
This variant adds more difficulty and interest. After hiking onto the self, the trail can disappear
and reappear. As long as you continue in the general direction you should not have problems.
Since you will be hiking above the usual trail, you will witness some incredible views of the
valley.
