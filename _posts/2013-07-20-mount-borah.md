Mt. Borah is the highest peak in Idaho.  This hike is very difficult, because it is steep.  There
are basically 3 section.  First section is a usual hike up to Chickenout Ridge.  The middle section
is technical climbing over the Chickenout Ridge.  The last section is a scramble to the top.

Make sure you are in a good shape before you go. This is very demanding hike.

Also, there is typically snow on the trial even in late August - the amount depends on the winter.
