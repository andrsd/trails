__Before you go:__ There were changes in trail routing, so your map will probably show a different
path. It is highly recommended to use the GPX file.

The trail is quite well defined and easy to follow all the way to the lakes. If you do not want to
do the whole "loop", just hike the southern fork (~ 4 miles / 6 km). That would be a very easy hike,
good for kids. Obviously, the best views start showing up during the climb up.

The trail continues to the Granite Basin and passes by one of the lakes. It continues to the Green
Lake and Green Mountain, but this options is more suitable for backpacking trip. I stopped by the
lake and had lunch, then I headed back.

The trail back follow Andy Stone Creek, and offers some views of Grand Teton.

Water is available at several spots and easily accessible from the trail.

This trail gets decent amount of traffic, so solitude is fairly low. It gets better the farther you
are from the trailhead. This is a popular location for backpacking.
