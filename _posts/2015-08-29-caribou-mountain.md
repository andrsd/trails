__Before you go__: This is not a marked trail. There is not really a trailhead or signs, so
approaching the mountain will take some navigation skills.  The access road NF-118 get progressively
worse, so get as far as you feel comfortable, find a spot next to the road, there are occasional
vehicles moving on the road, so you do not block it. You can hike on the road up to the "trailhead"
marked in the GPS file. It is not difficult.

The hike itself involves a lot of scrambling, so be in good shape.  Water is not available.
