  In Leadore, ID turn on Lee Creek Road and follow signs to Mill Creek Rd. After about 7.5 miles
  turn left onto forest road 010 (there will be a sign to Mill Lake) and continue to the
  intersection at mile 9.5. Turn onto forest road 006 and continue to the primitive trail head
  (about mile 12).  The road gets gradually worse. It should be doable with sedan. Easier when there
  was no rain.  4WD and high clearance vehicle is an advantage.

The trail is an 4WD road going to the Mill Lake. It is easy to follow and there is no steep
climb/descent.  Early in the season it has muddy spots, but nothing serious.  The trail crosses Mill
Creek and you may need to ford it, especially early in the season, but the ford is very easy.

There is a primitive camp site by the lake.
